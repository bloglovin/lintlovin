# Lintlovin

Lintlovin sets up your project for automatic linting and whitespace checking. On install it will set up a Grunt file, `.editorconfig`, `.jshitrc`, and a git hook that runs test before you push.

To run tests continually while editing run `grunt watch` in your project. To run tests manually just run `npm test`.
